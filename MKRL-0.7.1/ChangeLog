2025-02-17T10:22:18-06:00 Removed copy statements, which referred to code outside of the MKRL directory.
2025-02-20T21:06:15-06:00 Added FD-PP.CBL, which inserts a name into unnamed fields.

in RL.CBL
2025-02-22T17:06:37-06:00 Workaround to derive length from dimensional data by
applying OCCURS clauses to scalar fields.
2025-02-24T18:05:47-06:00 Put error messages in rmmf.sh for variable length
records and redefines
2025-02-25T11:47:01-06:00 Removed references to FD (File Descriptor) and

the two.
